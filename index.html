<h3 class="section-header">UK</h3>
Most villages, towns and cities are decorated with Christmas lights over Christmas. Often a famous person switches them on. The most famous Christmas lights in the UK are in Oxford Street in London. Every year they get bigger and better. Thousands of people go to watch the big 'switch on' around the beginning of November. Like a lot of countries, Nativity Plays and Carol Services are also very popular at Christmas time. The Church that I go to always has a Carols by Candlelight Service where the church is only lit up by candles. It is a very special service and always makes me feel very Christmassy! Lots of other British churches also have Carols by Candlelight and Christingle services.</p>
<h3 class="section-header">France</h3>
In France, a Nativity crib is often used to help decorate the house. French cribs have clay figures in them. During December some towns and cities, such as Marseilles, have fairs that sell Nativity figures. As well as having the normal Nativity figures in them, French scenes also have figures such as a Butcher, a Baker, a Policeman and a Priest. Yule Logs made out of Cherry Wood are often burned in French homes. The log is carried into the home on Christmas Eve and is sprinkled with red wine to make the log smell nice when it is burning. There is a custom that the log and candles are left burning all night with some food and drinks left out in case Mary and the baby Jesus come past during the night. </p>
<h3 class="section-header">Austria</h3>
Austria shares many Christmas traditions with its neighbour Germany, but also has many special Christmas customs of its own. During Advent, many families will have an Advent Wreath made from evergreen twigs and decorated with ribbons and four candles. One each of the four Sunday in Advent, a candle is lit and a carols or two might be sung! Most towns will have a 'Christkindlmarkt' (Christmas market) from late November, early December selling Christmas decorations, food (like gingerbread) and GlÃ¼hwein (sweet, warm mulled wine). Cities like Vienna, Innsbruck and Salzburg have huge markets and people from all over the world to visit them.

<h3 class="section-header">Zimbabwe</h3>
Zimbabwe is situated in the southern part of Africa, between South Africa and Zambia. Fellowship is a big part of Christmas Day in Zimbabwe. Since the country is located south of the equator, Kisimusi, or Christmas is celebrated December 25, during the broiling hot summer. Starting weeks in advance, everyone starts to gather loaves of bread, jam, tea, and sugar for the Christmas dinner. On Christmas Eve, a fir tree is placed in the main room and decorated with colorful ornaments, mostly hand crafted. Gifts are then placed under the tree and a member of the family, one of the elders, is selected to be the â€œSantaâ€ for the gift distribution on Christmas Day. Fathers give gifts to their children and wives, usually consisting of clothes and candy.</p>
<h3 class="section-header">Ghana</h3>
Christmas in Ghana is a well-deserved break, coinciding with the end of the cocoa harvest and beginning on December 1, four weeks before Christmas. Families decorate their homes and neighborhoods like we do here in the US, using lights, candles and sparkly ornaments. For most Ghanaians, it is just the beginning. On Christmas Day, things really kick into full swing, starting with a family meal, usually consisting of goat, vegetables and soup - and followed by a church service for the whole community and a colorful holiday parade.</p>
<h3 class="section-header">South Africa</h3>
One major difference is that in South Africa Christmas is celebrated in the middle of summer. Flowers are blooming, the sun is shining and everything is alive. All that vitality is brought to life even more by the festive mood of the people. The decorations, markets, carolers and Christmas dinner (which in South Africa is more of an outdoor lunch) help you get into the Christmas spirit. South Africa is a country with a great affinity for outdoor activities, so it's no surprise that thousands of people celebrate the holiday season with visits to Kruger National Park. Church services are held on Christmas morning. Christmas Eve celebrations in larger centers include "Carols by Candlelight" and special screen and floor shows.

                     <h3 class="section-header">Sri Lanka</h3>
For Christians in Sri Lanka, the Christmas season starts on 1st December when people let off fire crackers at dawn! The streets are decorated and the shopping centres have large Christmas Trees in them. Big companies have Christmas parties and large hotels have Christmas dinner dances. The Christians go to Midnight Mass services all over the country. They also invite friends, both Christian and non Christian to their homes for parties. New Year is also widely celebrated with more fire crackers! There are also Midnight Mass services for New Year. In Sri Lanka Santa is called Naththal Seeya.</p>
<h3 class="section-header">Pakistan</h3>
At Christian festivals, like Christmas and Easter, a big procession takes place, in Lahore, from St. Anthony's Church to the Cathedral. It takes hours to reach the Cathedral for the services. These are then celebrated with lots of enthusiasm! Before and during Advent, spiritual seminars take place to help people to prepare for Christmas or 'Bara Din' (which in Urdu and Punjabi means the 'Big Day'). This expression is very popular, even among Muslims in Pakistan.</p>
<h3 class="section-header">Japan</h3>
In Japan, Christmas in known as more of a time to spread happiness rather than a religious celebration. Christmas eve is often celebrated more than Christmas Day. Christmas eve is thought of as a romantic day, in which couples spend together and exchange presents. In many ways it resembles Valentine's Day celebrations in the UK and the USA. Young couples like to go for walks to look at the Christmas lights and have a romantic meal in a restaurant - booking a table on Christmas Eve can be very difficult as it's so popular! Fried chicken is often eaten on Christmas day. It is the busiest time of year for restaurants such as KFC and people can place orders at their local fast food restaurant in advance!

        Most Guatemalans, like other Latin-American counties, plan and build, with the entire family, a Nativity Scene called a "Nacimiento" or "Belen". The "Nacimiento" is normally put under the Christmas Tree. One unique characteristic of Guatemalan Nativity scenes is the use of sawdust dyed in many bright colors. On Christmas Eve families celebrate together and eat the main Christmas meal. It is made of several traditional dishes, but it always includes some Guatemalan tamales. In some regions they are made of corn and other of rice or potatoes. They can be sweet or not, and have several different ingredients inside like olives, prunes, peppers, chicken or pork.</p>
<h3 class="section-header">USA</h3>
Towns and cities often decorate the streets with lights to celebrate Christmas. Perhaps the most famous Christmas street lights in the USA are at the Rockerfeller Center in New York where there is a huge Christmas Tree with a public ice skating rink in front of it over Christmas and the New Year. In the Southwest USA, there are some special customs which have some similarities to those in parts of Mexico. These include 'luminarias' or 'farolitos' which are paper sacks partly filled with sand and then have a candle put in them. They are lit on Christmas Eve and are put the edges of paths. They represent 'lighting the way' for somewhere for Mary and Joseph to stay.</p>
<h3 class="section-header">Canada</h3>
On the south shore of Nova Scotia, over Christmas, there's the tradition of Belsnickeling where people dress up in funny Santa costumes and go from house to house until the home owners guess who you were. It was especially popular in West and East Green Harbour. The Belsnicklers often brought musical instruments and sang. They were served Christmas cake or cookies. "Sinck Tuck" is a festival started by the Inuit that is celebrated in some provinces of Canada. This celebration consists of dancing and gift exchanging.</p>
